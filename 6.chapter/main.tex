\textit{Fulfilling the objectives of the dissertation, fringe areas (in the sense that there is hardly any numerical tool that tackled these issues without serious simplifications) are explored in this chapter. These are intrinsically preliminary results and analysis of the solutions. There are no complete set of measurements on any of these cases and, as such, validation of the solution can not be performed directly. It is the hope of the author that the model can inspire more research on this class of topics, by presenting the first available interactive sketch on them.\\
For the sake of completeness, simulation times are included. All of the simulations were performed on a Nvidia Titan GPU from 2013.}
