	Data from experiments specifically designed with the intention to

	spatial flow heterogeneity is small at greater distances to the roughness
	tops (z100), increases slightly towards z100 , and increases significantly
	below z100. Form induced stresses determined over the same bed and
	with the same slope are found to be independent of discharge. The
	influence of the number of measuring verticals on the magnitude of
	form induced stresses is discussed. The distributions of form induced
	stresses are used to define the geodetic level of the roughness crest
	for rough, irregular beds from hydraulic data.},

	which should allow for detailed in situ studies of local shear stress
	at scales relevant to lotic organisms. Such information will be invaluable
	in studies of benthic organisms and hydraulically relevant phenomena
	in the near-bottom zone of lotic systems.},

  title = {Large eddy simulation and a simple wall model for turbulent flow

  journal = {International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {A turbulent channel flow and the flow around a cubic obstacle are
	calculated by the moving particle semi-implicit method with the subparticle-scale
	turbulent model and a wall model, which is based on the zero equation
	RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes). The wall model is useful
	in practical problems that often involve high Reynolds numbers and
	wall turbulence, because it is difficult to keep high resolution
	in the near-wall region in particle simulation. A turbulent channel
	flow is calculated by the present method to validate our wall model.
	The mean velocity distribution agrees with the log-law velocity profile
	near the wall. Statistical values are also the same order and tendency
	as experimental results with emulating viscous layer by the wall
	model. We also investigated the influence of numerical oscillations
	on turbulence analysis in using the moving particle semi-implicit
	method. Finally, the turbulent flow around a cubic obstacle is calculated
	by the present method to demonstrate capability of calculating practical
	turbulent flows. Three characteristic eddies appear in front of,
	over, and in the back of the cube both in our calculation and the
	experimental result that was obtained by Martinuzzi and Tropea. Mean
	velocity and turbulent intensity profiles are predicted in the same
	order and have similar tendency as the experimental result. Copyright

	flows are obtained using a recirculating flume. Cases in which a
	loose deposit forms underneath the flow are contrasted with runs
	for which basal shear occurs along the flume bottom. The granular
	motions are observed through the channel sidewall, and analysed with
	recently developed Voronoï¿½ imaging methods. Depth profiles of mean
	velocity, solid concentration, and granular temperature are obtained,
	and complemented by stress estimates based on force balance considerations.
	These measurements are used to probe variations in rheological behaviour
	over depth, and to clarify the role of the granular temperature.
	The flows are found to evolve a stratified structure. Distinct sub-layers
	are characterized by either frictional or collisional behaviour,
	and transitions between one and the other occur at values of the
	Stokes number which suggest that viscous effects intervene. The observed
	frictional behaviour is consistent with shear cell tests conducted
	at very low shear rates. On the other hand, the collisional data
	corroborate both the Bagnold description and the more recent kinetic
	theories of granular flows, provided that one accounts for the inertia
	of the interstitial liquid.},

	a Beam Warming, three-point backward implicit, finite difference

	method. These schemes are shown to be adequate solutions to accuracy
	and stability problems due to the discontinuities of the solution,
	the strongly time varying character of the flow, the dry/wet bed
	propagation phenomena and the rapid modification of the bed elevation.
	Numerical results for dam break flow over dry bed are compared with
	recent laboratory results. The maximum scour size dam is well predicted,
	and the hydraulic jump, induced by the strong erosion at the dam
	location, is reproduced. Investigation is extended to wet bed propagation,

  pages = {261-291},
  abstract = {This paper describes computer simulation studies of granular materials
	under dense conditions where particles are in persistent contact
	with their neighbours and the elasticity of the material becomes
	an important rheological parameter. There are two regimes at this
	limit, one for which the stresses scale with both elastic and inertial
	properties (called the elasticï¿½inertial regime), and a non-inertial
	quasi-static regime in which the stresses scale purely elastically
	(elasticï¿½quasi-static). In these elastic regimes, the forces are
	generated by internal force chains. Reducing the concentration slightly
	causes a transition from an elastic to a purely inertial behaviour.
	This transition occurs so abruptly that a 2% concentration reduction
	can be accompanied by nearly three orders of magnitude of stress
	reduction. This indicates that granular flows near this limit are
	prone to instabilities such as those commonly observed in shear cells.
	Unexpectedly, there is no path between inertial (rapid) flow and
	quasi-static flow by varying the shear rate at a fixed concentration;
	only by reducing the concentration can one cause a transition from
	quasi-static to inertial flow. The solid concentrations at which
	this transition occurs as well as the magnitude of the stresses in
	the elastic regimes are strong functions of the particle surface
	friction, because the surface friction strongly affects the strength
	of the force chains. A parametric analysis of the elastic regime
	generated flowmaps showing the various regimes that might be realized
	in practice. Many common materials such as sand require such large
	shear rates to reach the elasticï¿½inertial regime that it is unattainable
	for all practical purposes; such materials will demonstrate either
	an elasticï¿½quasi-static behaviour or a pure inertial behaviour
	depending on the concentration ï¿½ with many orders of magnitude
	of stress change between them. Finally, the effects of nonlinear
	contacts are investigated and an appropriate scaling is proposed
	that accounts for the nonlinear behaviour in the elasticï¿½quasi-static
	regime.},

	flow with attention both to the history and the underlying physics
	that govern the field. It starts with a discussion of the basic transport
	mechanisms in a granular flow. It continues with a discussion of
	contact mechanics - the way that individual particles see each other
	mechanically. It then discusses the historical limiting regimes of
	granular flow, the Quasistatic and the Rapid-Flow regimes. Finally,
	it concludes with a review of the Elastic picture of granular flow,
	which both unifies the Quasistatic and Rapid regimes and fills in
	the intervening space. It shows that the rheological behavior of
	granular systems changes with system scale constraints, and, in particular,
	that the materials behave differently under controlled-stress and
	controlled-concentration conditions. The Elastic model defines an
	entire flowmap of granular flow and thus allows one to place boundaries
	on where the Quasistatic and Rapid-Flow models (sometimes called
	kinetic theory models) are something of a red herring and cannot
	be applied to common granular flows.},

  abstract = {Three types of homogeneous anisotropic turbulence were produced by
	the plane distortion, axisymmetric expansion and axisymmetric contraction
	of grid-generated turbulence, and their behaviour in returning to
	isotropy was experimentally studied using hot-wire anemometry. It
	was found that the turbulence trajectory after the plane distortion
	was highly nonlinear, and did not follow Rotta's linear model in
	returning to isotropy. The turbulence wanted to become axisymmetric
	even more than it wanted to return to isotropy. In order to show
	the rate of return to isotropy of homogeneous turbulence, a map of
	the ratio of the characteristic time scale for the decay of turbulent
	kinetic energy to that of the return to isotropy was constructed.
	This demonstrated that the rate of return to isotropy was much lower
	for turbulence with a greater third invariant of the anisotropy tensor.
	The invariant technique was then applied to the experimental results
	to develop a new turbulence model for the return-to-isotropy term
	in the Reynolds stress equation which satisfied the realizability
	conditions. The effect of the Reynolds number on the rate of return
	to isotropy was also investigated and the results incorporated in
	the proposed model.},

	can providesignificant protection against wind erosion by extracting
	momentum from the flowand thereby reducing the shear stress acting
	at the surface. A theoretical model haspreviously been presented
	to specify the partition of drag forces for rough surfacesand to
	predict required vegetation density to suppress wind erosion. However,
	themodel parameters have not yet been constrained and the predictive
	capacity of themodel has remained uncertain. A wind-tunnel study
	was conducted to measure thedrag partition for a range of roughness
	densities and to parameterise the model inorder to improve its range
	of potential applicability. The drag forces acting on bothan array
	of roughness elements and the intervening surface were measured independentlyand
	simultaneously using new drag balance instrumentation. A detailed
	measure of thespatial heterogeneity of surface shear stresses was
	also made using Irwin sensors. Thedata agreed well with previous
	results and confirmed the general form of the model.Analysis of the
	drag partition confirmed the parameter definition ÃŸ = CR/CS(where
	CR and CS are roughness element and surface drag coefficients,respectively)
	and a constant proportional difference between the mean and maximumsurface
	shear stress was found. The results of this experiment suggest that
	the definitionfor m, the surface shear stress inhomogeneity parameter,
	should be revised, although thetheoretical and physical reasons for
	including this parameter in the model appear to bevalid. Best-fit
	values for m ranged from 0.53 to 0.58.},

	model the resistance to flow in a water flume for nonsubmerged and
	nonrigid vegetation to determine the amount that streamlining decreases
	the drag coefficient and reduces the momentum absorbing area. Currently,
	vegetation on floodplains is commonly assumed to behave as rigid
	roughness that can lead to large errors in the relationships between
	velocity and drag force. This presents a basic fluid mechanics problem.
	An extreme variation of roughness with depth of flow can result due
	to a large increase in the momentum absorbing area in nonsubmerged
	vegetation as depth is increased. This deems all the available roughness
	equations (which generally are based on relative roughness approach)
	useless for this application. In this paper a dimensional analysis,
	supported by experimental results, is developed to obtain a relationship
	between roughness conditions (i.e., density and flexural rigidity)
	and flow conditions (i.e., velocity and depth) for floodplains and
	vegetative zones of natural waterways.},

  journal = {Minerals Engineering},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {24},
  pages = {741 - 753},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {Large banana screens with multiple decks are used extensively in the
	process separation of many valuable export commodities. They are
	high capacity vibrating screens with a curved profile. Discrete Element
	Method (DEM) modelling using non-spherical particles has previously
	provided significant insight into the operation of these dry industrial
	screens. Here we introduce the use of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
	(SPH) to model the flow of slurry (water and fine material) through
	a double deck banana screen. This paper firstly reports on the underlying
	\{DEM\} model of the coarse particulate flow on a full-scale banana
	screen. We then use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model
	the transport of fine particle slurry over and through the double
	deck banana screen. Finally, we combine the \{DEM\} with \{SPH\}
	models using a one-way coupling to simulate the effects of adding
	a slurry flow to coarse particulates on the banana screen. The key
	outcomes from this study are that; \{SPH\} is ideally suited for
	the high speeds and the high fragmented and filamentary nature of
	the fluid flow through the screen deck openings; the fluid only (SPH)
	model of slurry behaves similarly to the \{DEM\} approach in that
	more fluid is screened as the velocity slows, except near the earlier
	panels on the top deck; and, use of a porous media derived from \{DEM\}
	in one-way coupled approach with \{SPH\} produces clear and reasonable
	changes in fluid structure, separation and wetting of the screens
	consistent with slurry behaviour. Specifically, the fluid layer was
	much thicker in the coupled case, with slurry being trapped inside
	a coarse particle bed and which is sensitive to the fluid viscosity.

  abstract = {Increased sediment production resulting from the erosion of unprotected
	soil in a catchment may result in severe changes in the morphodynamics
	and hydrodynamics of mountain rivers. Sediment overfeeding can lead
	to the degradation of salmonidsï¿½ spawning sites. The objective
	of this study is to evaluate the impacts of sand transport on flow
	hydrodynamics and on vertical dissolved oxygen (DO) distribution
	in gravel-bed rivers. To accomplish the proposed objective, conditions
	similar to those found in nature, in what concerns flow and bed material,
	were reproduced in a laboratory flume and a theoretical model of
	the vertical distribution of DO was developed. Three laboratory tests
	simulated (i) an undisturbed openwork gravel bed; (ii) a frameworksupported
	gravel bed with a sand matrix and (iii) a framework-supported gravel
	bed with imposed sand transport at near-capacity conditions. Instantaneous
	velocity maps were obtained with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).
	The collected data were analysed and theoretically framed with double-averaged
	methods (DAM). Mean Reynolds stresses were unaffected by reduced
	bed porosity or sediment transport even in the near-bed region. Sediment
	transport affected longitudinal velocity profiles and eddy viscosity
	decreased. Numerical simulations of the vertical distribution of
	DO and of gaseous species were carried out under the hydrodynamic
	and sedimentological conditions of the flume work. The results of
	the numerical simulations show that, in the presence of sand transport,
	near-bed concentrations of DO are strongly reduced, mostly due to
	the reduction of downward diffusive fluxes of gaseous oxygen and
	DO.},

	local equilibrium. Velocity moments scale with single length and
	time scales throughout the layer rather than depending on height.
	Large coherent structures control turbulence dynamics. Sweeps rather

	dam-break simulations in 2-D and 3-D. The foundations of the method

	methods and it has the added advantage that it requires no parameters.
	Several methods for replacing sequences of spurious data are presented.

  abstract = {Aquatic macrophytes can severely retard flow rates in the river channels
	that they occupy. Consequently, there is a need to improve our ability
	to model vegetation resistance, to aid flood prediction and allow
	for better-informed channel management. An empirical model is developed
	to calculate flow resistance (Manning's resistance coefficient) of
	channels containing the submergent macrophyte Ranunculus (water-crowfoot).
	Blockage factors (the proportion of a cross-section blocked by vegetation)
	were determined for up to nine cross-sections at each of 35 river
	sites. These were used to create blockage-factor percentiles, which
	were regressed against vegetation resistance. An exponential best-fit
	relation involving the 69th blockage-factor percentile gave the best
	results. A parameter relating the length of the vegetated/solid boundary
	in contact with the open channel to the length of the conventionally-
	defined wetted perimeter improved the model fit by acting as a pseudo-measure
	of the turbulent-energy losses generated within the unvegetated stream
	by the macrophytes. The model was tested on three additional sites
	containing different macrophyte species and much higher vegetation
	blockages, and was found to work well.},

  abstract = { Free surface flows represent a significant problem in computational
	fluid dynamics (CFD). The difficulties are multiplied when the free
	surfaces overturn or impact against solid surfaces, especially if
	air is entrapped in the process. Although many models capable of
	simulating such flows have been reported in the literature, particle-based
	methods such as SPH are arguably the most appealing conceptually
	and intuitively. In this paper, we model water flows with free surfaces.We
	assume that the flows are incompressible. There are many different
	implementations of SPH but there are two main approaches for modelling
	incompressible flows. In weakly-compressible SPH (WCSPH) computations
	of water flows, fluid pressure is related to particle density using
	a stiff equation of state. An alternative is incompressible SPH (ISPH).
	Here, a Poisson equation is solved to determine the pressure in an
	approach based upon the orthogonal decomposition method frequently
	used in grid-based methods. Recent work by Lee et al. (2008) has
	shown that, under certain circumstances, ISPH performs better than
	WCSPH for several flows. In this paper, we compare WCSPH and ISPH
	results for two standard dam-break problems and for regular water
	waves impacting against a vertical wall. Results are compared with
	experimental data where possible and show qualitative and quantitative
	agreement. In our version of WCSPH, MLS or Shephard filtering density
	â€˜renormalisationâ€™ methods are used and a variety of boundary
	condition formulations are tested and it is concluded that in the
	optimum configuration, WCSPH performs at least as well as ISPH, and
	in some respects clearly performs better. },

	There is first a slumping phase, during which the current is retarded

	remains in this slumping phase until the depth ratio of current to
	intruded fluid is reduced to less than about 0,075. This may be followed

	force. Motion in the surrounding fluid plays a negligible role in
	this phase. There then follows a viscous phase, wherein the buoyancy

	It is based on a noise spectrum reconstruction from cross-spectra
	evaluations of two independent and simultaneous measurements of the
	same vertical velocity component over the whole water depth. The
	noise spectra and the noise variances are calculated and removed
	for the three fluctuating velocity components measured in turbulent,
	open-channel flow. The corrected turbulence spectra show a -5/3 slope
	over the whole inertial subrange delimited by the frequency band
	of the device, while the uncorrected turbulence spectra have flat
	high-frequency regions typical for noise effects. This method does

	turbulent energy balance equation terms, such as production, transport,
	and dissipation, are in better agreement with different semitheoretical
	formulas and other measurements from the literature than those from
	the uncorrected data. Combined with the use of a phase array emitter,
	the proposed correction method allows measurements with a relative
	error under 10% in the outer flow region. The corrected inner flow
	region measurements are still affected by errors that may originate
	from spatial averaging effects within the sample volume due to the
	high local velocity gradient or the lack of validity of the universal

  abstract = {A novel noise reduction method and corresponding technique are presented
	for improving turbulence measurements with acoustic Doppler velocimeters
	(ADVs) commonly used in field studies of coastal and nearshore regions,
	rivers, lakes, and estuaries. This bifrequency method is based on
	the decorrelation of the random and statistically independent Doppler
	noise terms contained in the Doppler signals at two frequencies.
	It is shown through experiments in an oscillating grid turbulence
	(OGT) tank producing diffusive isotropic turbulence that a shift
	in carrier frequency of less than 10\% is sufficient to increase
	the resolved frequency range by a decade in the turbulent velocity
	spectra. Over this spectral range, the slope of the velocity spectra
	agrees well with the universal inertial range value of âˆ’5/3. The
	limit due to spatial averaging effects over the sample volume can
	be determined from the abrupt deviation of the spectral slope from
	the âˆ’5/3 value. As a result, the relative error of the turbulent
	intensity estimate and the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation
	rate, measured by two different methods, does not exceed 10\% in
	the case of isotropic turbulence. Furthermore, the bifrequency method
	allows accurate estimates of the turbulent microscales as shown by
	the good agreement of the ratio between the Taylor and Kolmogorov
	microscales and an ${Re}^{\frac{1}{4}}$ power law. Compared to previous
	Doppler noise reduction methods (Garbini et al.), an increase in
	time resolution by a factor of 4 is achieved. The proposed method
	also avoids the loss of TKE energy contained in isotropic flow structures
	of size equal to and smaller than the sample volume. Different from
	Doppler noise methods proposed by Hurther and Lemmin and Blanckaert
	and Lemmin, this method does not require additional hardware components,
	electronic circuitry, or sensors because the redundant instantaneous
	velocity field information is captured with the same transducer.
	The required shift in carrier frequency is small enough for the bifrequency
	method to be easily implemented in commercial ADVs.},

  volume = {35(3)},
  pages = {245-296},
  abstract = {Recent advances in theory and experimentation motivate a thorough
	reassessment of the physics of debris flows. Analyses of flows of
	dry, granular solids and solid-fluid mixtures provide a foundation
	for a comprehensive debris flow theory, and experiments provide data
	that reveal the strengths and limitations of theoretical models.
	Both debris flow materials and dry granular materials can sustain
	shear stresses while remaining static; both can deform in a slow,
	tranquil mode characterized by enduring, frictional grain contacts;
	and both can flow in a more rapid, agitated mode characterized by
	brief, inelastic grain collisions. In debris flows, however, pore
	fluid that is highly viscous and nearly incompressible, composed
	of water with suspended silt and clay, can strongly mediate intergranular
	friction and collisions. Grain friction, grain collisions, and viscous
	fluid flow may transfer significant momentum simultaneously. Both
	the vibrational kinetic energy of solid grains (measured by a quantity
	termed the granular temperature) and the pressure of the intervening
	pore fluid facilitate motion of grains past one another, thereby
	enhancing debris flow mobility. Granular temperature arises from
	conversion of flow translational energy to grain vibrational energy,
	a process that depends on shear rates, grain properties, boundary
	conditions, and the ambient fluid viscosity and pressure. Pore fluid
	pressures that exceed static equilibrium pressures result from local
	or global debris contraction. Like larger, natural debris flows,
	experimental debris flows of ?10 mï¿½ of poorly sorted, water-saturated
	sediment invariably move as an unsteady surge or series of surges.
	Measurements at the base of experimental flows show that coarse-grained
	surge fronts have little or no pore fluid pressure. In contrast,
	finer-grained, thoroughly saturated debris behind surge fronts is
	nearly liquefied by high pore pressure, which persists owing to the
	great compressibility and moderate permeability of the debris. Realistic
	models of debris flows therefore require equations that simulate
	inertial motion of surges in which high-resistance fronts dominated
	by solid forces impede the motion of low-resistance tails more strongly
	influenced by fluid forces. Furthermore, because debris flows characteristically
	originate as nearly rigid sediment masses, transform at least partly
	to liquefied flows, and then transform again to nearly rigid deposits,
	acceptable models must simulate an evolution of material behavior
	without invoking preternatural changes in material properties. A
	simple model that satisfies most of these criteria uses depth-averaged
	equations of motion patterned after those of the Savage-Hutter theory
	for gravity-driven flow of dry granular masses but generalized to
	include the effects of viscous pore fluid with varying pressure.
	These equations can describe a spectrum of debris flow behaviors
	intermediate between those of wet rock avalanches and sediment-laden
	water floods. With appropriate pore pressure distributions the equations
	yield numerical solutions that successfully predict unsteady, nonuniform
	motion of experimental debris flows.},

	the flow, except for a narrow range of rotation ratios 0<f /S<1.
	The main mechanism for the flowï¿½s destabilization is an increased
	turbulence production due to increased anisotropy. Reynolds stress
	and the dissipation rate anisotropy tensors have been evaluated and
	provide a reference for newly defined anisotropy measures. Wavelet-based
	directional energies capture the properties of velocity gradients.
	The intermittency of the flow in different directions is quantified
	with scale-dependent directional flatness. Scale-dependent helicity
	probability distribution functions allow one to statistically characterize
	the geometry of the motion at different scales. Small scales are
	found locally to be predominantly helical, while large scales are
	not since they tend to two-dimensionalization for cases with growing
	turbulent kinetic energy. Joint probability distribution functions
	show that the signs of velocity helicity and vorticity helicity are
	strongly correlated. This indicates that vorticity helicity tends
	to diminish velocity helicity.},

	equation is therefore not appropriate. A detailed approach requires

	0.1-100 cm/km. However, the depth range is small, so the combined

  abstract = { This experimental study explores the distribution of Reynolds shear
	stresses and turbulence intensities for a flume receiving lateral
	inflow via a set of vertical nozzles. The data set allows for developing
	turbulence models to describe a wider range of spatially-varied flow
	conditions. The turbulent flow structures are detailed both in the
	near-field close to where the flow enters the flume, and in the far-field.
	It was found that a lateral inflow increases the turbulence level,
	but it decreases in the transverse direction towards the side walls.
	As the lateral inflow rate increases, the turbulence parameters increase
	only slightly. The turbulence parameters also increase from the upstream
	end of the lateral inflow zone towards the downstream end. The turbulent
	kinetic energy (TKE) production was estimated. Small regions of negative
	TKE production exist, which are typically near the lateral inflow
	addition. },

	us (Langston et al., 1994) in several respects. We introduce a continuous
	and gradual hopper filling method, a more realistic normal-tangential
	interaction between the particles, particle size polydispersity,
	and the model is extended from two to three dimensions (3D). The
	hopper discharge rate has been computed as a function of material
	head height, outlet size and the hopper half-angle. The model results
	are, in general, in very good agreement with established literature
	empirical predictions. The hopper wall stresses have been compared
	in the static state after filling and in the dynamic state during
	discharge. Generally there is encouraging agreement with predictions
	from the continuum differential slice force balance method, with
	significant improvements over our previous work. We have also observed,
	for the first time in a discrete element simulation of hoppers, the
	appearance of rupture zones within the material and associated wall
	stress peaks where the rupture zones intersect with the hopper wall.
	We consider that the current model is more successful than the previous
	one because the particle interactions include a much greater level
	of frictional "engagement" at low loads, with less variation at high
	loads.},

	A computational fluid dynamics model is applied with high resolution
	to simulating turbulent flows over arrays of roughness elements positioned
	on a smooth surface. The skin drag on the surface and the pressure
	drag on the roughness elements are computed. The simulated drag partition
	compares well with wind-tunnel measurements and theoretical estimates
	for similar rough surfaces. This confirms that the computational
	approach offers an alternative to wind-tunnel and field experiments
	in studying drag and drag partition. The model is then applied to
	studying drag partition over rough surfaces with various roughness
	configurations. It is shown that drag partition depends not only
	on the magnitude of the roughness frontal area but also on the sizes
	and arrangement of roughness elements, because (1) the pressure drag
	coefficient is sensitive to roughness-element dimensions and (2)
	the arragement of roughness elements lead to different interferences
	of turbulent wakes. The impact of the latter factor is not insignificant.},

  journal = {Phys. Fluids},

  abstract = {The behavior of turbulent open channel flows over permeable surfaces
	is not well understood. In particular, it is not clear how the surface
	and the subsurface flow within the permeable bed interact and influence
	each other. In order to clarify this issue we carried out two sets
	of experiments, one involving velocity measurements in open channel
	flows over an impermeable bed composed of a single layer of spheres,
	and another one where velocities were measured over and within a
	permeable bed made of five such layers. Comparison of surface flow
	velocity statistics between the two sets of experiments confirmed
	that bed permeability can significantly affect flow resistance. It
	was also confirmed that even in the hydraulically rough regime, the
	friction factors for the permeable bed increase with increasing Reynolds
	number. Such an increase in flow resistance implies a different distribution
	of normal form-induced stress between the permeable and impermeable
	bed cases. Subsurface flow measurements performed within the permeable
	bed revealed that there is an intense transport of turbulent kinetic
	energy TKE occurring from the surface to the subsurface flow. We
	provide evidence that the transport of TKE toward the lower bed levels
	is driven mainly by pressure fluctuations, whereas TKE transport
	due to turbulent velocity fluctuations is limited to a thinner layer
	placed in the upper part of the bed. It was also confirmed that the
	turbulence imposed by the surface flow gradually dissipates while
	penetrating within the porous medium. Dissipation occurs faster for
	the small scales than for the large ones, which instead are persistent,
	although weak, even at the lowest bed levels.},

	show how such SPH simulations of complex 3D problems involving a
	free surface can be performed on a super computer like the IBM Blue
	Gene/L with 8,192 cores of Ecole polytechnique fÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne.
	The present paper thus presents the different techniques which had
	to be included into the SPH model to make possible such simulations.
	Memory handling, in particular, is a quite subtle issue because of
	constraints due to the use of a variable-h scheme. These improvements
	made possible the simulation of test cases involving hundreds of
	million particles computed by using thousands of cores. Speedup and
	efficiency of these parallel calculations are studied. The model
	capabilities are illustrated in the paper for two water entry problems,
	firstly, on a simple test case involving a sphere impacting the free
	surface at high velocity; and secondly, on a complex 3D geometry
	involving a ship hull impacting the free surface in forced motion.
	Sensitivity to spatial resolution is investigated as well in the
	case of the sphere water entry, and the flow analysis is performed
	by comparing both experimental and theoretical reference results.

  abstract = {This investigation focuses on the characteristics of near-bed turbulence
	in fully rough gravel-bed open-channel flows. The analysis combines
	results obtained with the double-averaging methodology and local
	flow characterization, using velocity measurements provided by a
	high-resolution three-axis Acoustic Doppler Velocity Profiler (ADVP).
	As a result of the flow heterogeneity induced by the bed topography,
	the flow is not locally uniform in the near-bed region, and a double-averaging
	methodology is applied over a length scale much greater than the
	gravel size. In smooth- and rough-bed flow conditions, without macro-roughness
	bed elements, maximum turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) production occurs
	very close to z=0, while in our case with fully rough flows with
	macro-roughness elements, maximum turbulence activity is found to
	occur at gravel crest levels zc (zc/h=0.1). Turbulent diffusion also
	reaches a maximum at this elevation. The characteristics of the spatially
	averaged TKE budget are in good agreement with those obtained in
	flows over canopies. The hydrodynamic double-averaged properties
	have strong similarities with mixing layers and reattached mixing
	layers in flows over backward facing steps. Local time-averaged velocity
	profiles can be split into three typical classes, namely log, S-shaped
	and accelerated. It appears that the S-shaped class profiles, located
	in the wakes of the macro-roughness elements, exhibit an inflectional
	profile typical of mixing layers. They are of major importance in
	the double-averaged TKE budget, as they provide a local high contribution
	to the double-averaged TKE flux, TKE production and dissipation compared
	to the log class profiles. Consequently, doubleaveraged TKE production
	is roughly 75% greater than the dissipation rate at the point of
	maximal TKE production. Moreover the macro-roughness bed elements
	imply mixing-layer-type hydrodynamics that play a dominant role in
	the overall structure of mean near-bed turbulence of gravel-bed channel
	flows.},

	the flow is not uniform locally in the near bed region and a double
	averaging methodology is applied over a length scale much larger
	than the gravel size. The double-averaged Turbulent Kinetic Energy
	(TKE) budget derived in the context of the present flow over a gravel
	bed differs from the TKE budget written for flow over a vegetation
	canopy. The non-constant shape of the roughness function measured
	in our gravel bed leads to an additional bed-induced production term
	which is null for vertical roughness elements, such as simplified
	vegetation elements. The experimental estimation of the terms of
	the TKE budget reveals that the maximum turbulent activity takes
	place away from the reference plane, near the roughness crests. However,
	within the interface sublayer the work of the bed induced velocity
	fluctuations against the Reynolds stress is of the same magnitude
	as the main turbulence production term. Consequently, the characteristics
	of the TKE budget have similarities with uniform flows over canopies

	rough flows over sedimentlike beds.},

  abstract = {It is shown that the statistical orthogonality of the Karhunen-Loeve
	(KL) eigenfunctions with respect to both energy and dissipation makes
	them a particularly good basis for the definition of an energy spectrum
	in inhomogeneous fluid flows. An effective wave number is defined
	to characterize the KL eigenfunctions. The definition preserves the
	relationship between the dissipation and energy spectra that holds
	for Fourier spectra. With the spectrum and wave number so defined,
	the scale-similarity arguments that lead to the existence of a spectral
	inertial range apply. It is also shown that the existence of a spectral
	inertial range in the KL eigenspectrum is consistent with Kolmogorovï¿½s
	scale-similarity formulation for structure functions. An example
	of the KL spectrum obtained from a numerically simulated plane channel
	flow is presented.},

	submerged vegetation, including discussions of turbulence structure,
	mean velocity profiles, and dispersion. For submerged canopies of
	sufficient density, the dominant characteristic of the flow is the
	generation of a shear-layer at the top of the canopy. The shear-layer
	generates coherent vortices by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability.
	These vortices control the vertical exchange of mass and momentum,
	influencing both the mean velocity profile, as well as the turbulent
	diffusivity. For flexible canopies, the passage of the KH vortices
	generates a progressive wave along the canopy interface, termed monami.
	The KH vortices formed at the top of the canopy penetrate a distance
	\delta e into the canopy. This penetration scale segregates the canopy
	into an upper layer of rapid transport and a lower layer of slow
	transport. Flushing of the upper canopy is enhanced by the energetic
	shear-scale vortices. In the lower layer turbulence is limited to
	length-scales set by the stem geometry, and the resulting transport
	is significantly slower than that of the upper layer.},

	basis for the hydraulics of rough-bed open-channel flows, especially
	with small relative submergence. The relationships for the vertical
	distribution of the total stress for the simplest case of 2D, steady,
	uniform, spatially averaged flow over a rough bed with flat free
	surface are derived. These relationships explicitly include the form-induced
	stresses and form drag as components of the total stress. Using this
	approach, we define three types of rough-bed flows: (1) Flow with
	high relative submergence; (2) flow with small relative submergence;
	and (3) flow over a partially inundated rough bed. The relationships
	for the double-averaged velocity distribution and hydraulic resistance
	for all three flow types are derived and compared with measurements
	where possible. The double-averaged turbulent and form-induced intensities
	and stresses for the case of regular spherical-segment-type roughness
	show the dominant role of the double-averaged turbulence stresses
	and form drag in momentum transfer in the near-bed region.},

	basis for the hydraulics of rough-bed open-channel flows, especially
	with small relative submergence. The relationships for the vertical
	distribution of the total stress for the simplest case of 2D, steady,
	uniform, spatially averaged flow over a rough bed with flat free
	surface are derived. These relationships explicitly include the form-induced
	stresses and form drag as components of the total stress. Using this
	approach, we define three types of rough-bed flows: (1) Flow with
	high relative submergence; (2) flow with small relative submergence;
	and (3) flow over a partially inundated rough bed. The relationships
	for the double-averaged velocity distribution and hydraulic resistance
	for all three flow types are derived and compared with measurements
	where possible. The double-averaged turbulent and form-induced intensities
	and stresses for the case of regular spherical-segment-type roughness
	show the dominant role of the double-averaged turbulence stresses
	and form drag in momentum transfer in the near-bed region.},

	more stable and accurate results in all kinds of rigid body interactions,
	especially in rigidâ€”rigid interaction since our boundary force
	faithfully reflects the dynamic features of rigid body. With our
	impulse-based boundary force, SPH fluid solver is capable of full
	two way interaction of fluid and rigid body and it turns to be a
	particle-based rigid body solver if only rigid bodies are simulated

	stresses and associated spectra contributed from the attached eddies
	can be computed without any further empirical constants. This is
	done by using the momentum equation and certain convolution integrals
	developed here based on the attached eddy hypothesis. The theory
	is developed using data from equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium flows.
	In Part 2 the authors non-equilibrium data are used. },

	The two-dimensional numerical simulations are validated by comparing
	the wake size, drag coefficient and local heat transfer for flow
	past a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers near 100. The central
	focus of the work, however, is in computing flows of liquid-solid
	mixtures, such as the classic shear-cell experiments of Bagnold.
	Hence, the simulations were performed for neutrally buoyant particles
	contained between two plates for different solid fractions, fluid
	viscosities and shear rates. The tangential force resulting from
	the presence of particles shows an increasing dependence on the shear
	rate as observed in the Bagnold experiments. The normal force shows
	large variations with time, whose source is presently unclear but
	independent of the direct collisions between particles and the walls.},

	of SPH to Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of two-dimensional turbulence
	in a square box with no-slip boundaries. The primary focus of this
	section is to evaluate how well SPH can reproduce the primary characteristics
	of 2D wall-bounded turbulence. These characteristics include those
	near the no-slip boundaries of the box (e.g. the boundary layer and
	vortex roll-up) as well as those in the central turbulent flow (e.g.
	the inverse energy and direct enstrophy cascades).},

	section of the channel. Over the point bar, the secondary flow was
	entirely outward, i.e., toward the outer bank. The changes in flow
	led to changes in bar shape. Although the region of the bar closest
	to the inner bank accumulated sediment, erosion of the bar and the
	removal of plants by scouring were observed at the interface between
	the planted bar and the open channel.},

  number = {10},
  abstract = {This paper reports the results of an experimental study characterizing
	turbulence and turbulence anisotropy in smooth and rough shallow
	open-channel flows. The rough bed consists of a train of two-dimensional
	transverse square ribs with a ratio of the roughness height (k) to
	the total depth of flow (d) equal to 0.10. Three rib separations
	(p/k) of 4.5, 9, and 18 were examined. Here, p is the pitch between
	consecutive roughness elements and was varied to reproduce the classical
	condition of d- and k-type roughness. For each case, two-component
	velocity measurements were obtained using a laser Doppler velocimetry
	system at two locations for p/k=4.5 and 9: on the top of the rib
	and above the cavity, and an additional location for p/k=18. The
	measurements allow examination of the local variations of the higher-order
	turbulent moments, stress ratios as well as turbulence anisotropy.
	Large variations of the turbulence intensities, Reynolds shear stress,
	turbulent kinetic energy and turbulence production are found for
	y1<3k. In this region, the flow is more directly influenced by the
	shear layers from the preceding ribs. The higher-order moments appear
	to be similar for all rough surfaces beyond y1approx.7k. In the outer
	layer (y1>3k), all higher-order turbulent moments for the k-type
	roughness show a substantial increase due to the complex interactions
	between the roughness and the remnants overlying shear layers shed
	from succeeding ribs. Analysis of the components of the Reynolds
	stress anisotropy tensor shows that at p/k=18, the flow at y1<5k
	tends to be more isotropic which implies that for this particular
	case, the effect of the roughness density could also be important.
	On the smooth bed, at the shallower depths, the correlation coefficient
	near the free surface increases and turbulence tends to become less
	anisotropic.},

  title = {Local isotropy in turbulent boundary layers at high Reynolds number},
  journal = {Journal of Fluid Mechanics},
  year = {1994},
  volume = {268},
  pages = {333-372},
  abstract = {To test the local-isotropy predictions of Kolmogorovï¿½s (1 941) universal
	equilibrium theory, we have taken hot-wire measurements of the velocity
	fluctuations in the testsection-ceiling boundary layer of the 80
	x 120 foot Full-Scale Aerodynamics Facility at NASA Ames Research
	Center, the worldï¿½s largest wind tunnel. The maximum Reynolds numbers
	based on momentum thickness, R,, and on Taylor microscale, R,, were
	approximately 370000 and 1450 respectively. These are the largest
	ever attained in laboratory boundary-layer flows. The boundary layer
	develops over a rough surface, but the Reynolds-stress profiles agree
	with canonical data sufficiently well for present purposes. Spectral
	and structure-function relations for isotropic turbulence were used
	to test the local-isotropy hypothesis, and our results have established
	the condition under which local isotropy can be expected. To within
	the accuracy of measurement, the shear-stress cospectral density
	EJ, which is the most sensitive indicator of local isotropy, fell
	to zero at a wavenumber about a decade larger than that at which
	the energy spectra first followed -t power laws. At the highest Reynolds
	number, E,,(k,) vanished about one decade before the start of the
	dissipation range, and it remained zero in the dissipation range.
	The lower wavenumber limit of locally isotropic behaviour of the
	shear-stress cospectra is given by k,(s/S3)4 x 10 where S is the
	mean shear, aU/tly. The current investigation also indicates that
	for energy spectra this limit may be relaxed to k,(e/P)i M 3 ; this
	is Corrsinï¿½s (1958) criterion, with the numerical value obtained
	from the present data. The existence of an isotropic inertial range
	requires that this wavenumber be much less than the wavenumber at
	the onset of viscous effects, k, 7 4 1, so that the combined condition
	(Corrsin 1958; Uberoi 1957), is S(v/e)i 4 1. Among other detailed
	results, it was observed that in the dissipation range the energy
	spectra had a simple exponential decay (Kraichnan 1959) with an exponent
	prefactor close to the value /3 = 5.2 obtained in direct numerical
	simulations at low Reynolds number. The inertial-range constant for
	the three-dimensional spectrum, C, was estimated to be 1.5f0.1 (Monin
	\& Yaglom 1975). Spectral ï¿½bumpsï¿½ between the -: inertial range
	and the dissipative range were observed on all the compensated energy
	spectra. The shear-stress cospectra rolled-off with a -$ power law
	before the start of local isotropy in the energy spectra, and scaled
	linearly with S (Lumley 1967). In summary, it is shown that one decade
	of inertial subrange with truly negligible shear-stress cospectral
	density requires S(v/e)f of not more than about 0.01 (for a shear
	layer with turbulent kinetic energy production approximately equal
	to dissipation, a microscale Reynolds number of about 1500). For
	practical purposes many of the results of the hypothesis may be relied
	on at somewhat lower Reynolds numbers.},

	Typically, flows encountered in constructed wetland ponds are characterized
	by low Reynolds numbers, at times even within the laminar flow regime.
	In such conditions the injection of salt may cause strong density
	effects, thereby threatening the usefulness of the recorded breakthrough
	curves. The processes and mechanisms governing the formation of density
	stratification due to salt tracer injections into wetland ponds with
	emergent vegetation were studied in the laboratory. The results reported

	which are used in many different fields to model turbulent flows.
	In its present time formulation, this hypothesis corresponds to an
	alignment between the Reynolds stress and mean strain tensors. We
	begin with historical remarks on Boussinesq's results and recall
	that he introduced a local averaging twenty years before Reynolds,
	but using an approach that prevented him from discovering Reynolds'
	stress tensor. We then introduce an indicator that characterizes
	the validity of this hypothesis. For experimental and numerical databases,
	when the tensors are known, this can be used to directly estimate
	the validity of this hypothesis. We show, using several different
	databases, that this hypothesis is almost never verified. We address,
	in conclusion, the analogy with kinetic theory, and the reason why
	this analogy cannot be applied, in general, for turbulent flows.

	were conducted in a hydraulic laboratory model scaled 1:1 to study
	processes and mechanisms governing sediment transport under well

	settling were varied and their effect studied ceteris paribus. These
	governing parameters were flow velocity, TSS input concentration,
	presence of plants, vegetation density, and the presence of wind.
	Changes in sediment removal due to different parameters were analyzed
	by means of deposition curves in main flow direction.We found that
	particle settling is enhanced by increased inflow concentrations
	of suspended solids in the absence of plant stems (substance used:
	kaolin), whereas deposition is reduced by wind shear. The presence
	of plant stems strengthens vertical mixing and, consequently, does
	not generally result in enhanced deposition of suspended solids.
	Higher plant densities tend to be associated with lower settling
	rates. The effect of flow velocity on particle settling is small
	for the present experimental set-up.},

	in many engineering applications. The cylinders may be arranged in
	tandem, side-by-side, or staggered configurations. Wake and proximity
	interference effects, which are determined primarily by the longitudinal

	the current understanding of the flow around two ï¿½infiniteï¿½ circularcylinders
	of equal diameter immersed in a steady cross-flow, with a focus on
	the near-wake flow patterns, Reynolds number effects, intermediate
	wake structure and behaviour, and the general trends in the measurements
	of the aerodynamic force coefficients and Strouhal numbers. A primary
	focus is on the key experimental and numerical studies that have

  number = {2},
  abstract = {Wind tunnel experiments were conducted to measure the mean aerodynamic
	forces and vortex shedding frequencies for two staggered circular
	cylinders of equal diameter in cross-flow. The Reynolds number based
	on cylinder diameter ranged from Re=3.2Ã—104 to 7.4Ã—104, the centre-to-centre
	pitch ratio was varied from P/D=1.125 to 4.0, and the incidence angle
	was incremented in small steps from Î± = 0 Â° to 90Â°. The mean drag
	and lift force coefficients and the Strouhal numbers were obtained
	for both the upstream and downstream cylinders. From the behaviour
	of the experimental data, the staggered configuration could be broadly
	classified by the pitch ratio as closely spaced (1.5), moderately
	spaced (1.5â©½P/Dâ©½2.5), or widely spaced (2.5). Closely spaced
	staggered cylinders are characterized by mean aerodynamic forces
	that undergo large changes in magnitude and direction with the incidence
	angle for both cylinders. The same Strouhal number is measured behind
	both cylinders, an indication of single-bluff-body behaviour. Moderately
	spaced staggered cylinders are characterized by small changes in
	the mean aerodynamic forces on the upstream cylinder, but a relatively
	complex behaviour of the mean aerodynamic forces on the downstream
	cylinder. Two Strouhal numbers are measured for most incidence angles.
	For both closely spaced and moderately spaced configurations, a critical
	incidence angle was found that is associated with a local maximum
	drag coefficient on the upstream cylinder, a maximum inward-directed
	lift coefficient for the downstream cylinder (known as the inner
	lift peak), a local minimum drag coefficient for the downstream cylinder,
	and a maximum value for the Strouhal number. Widely spaced staggered
	cylinders are characterized by mean aerodynamic forces on the upstream
	cylinder that are mostly unchanged from the single cylinder, and
	a single Strouhal number for both cylinders indicative of synchronized
	vortex shedding from both cylinders at all incidence angles. The
	mean aerodynamic forces on the downstream cylinder are marked by
	a minimum drag coefficient in the tandem configuration and the appearance
	of the outer lift peak. The outer lift peak for the downstream cylinder
	is associated with the proximity or impingement of shed KÃ¡rmÃ¡n
	vortices from the upstream cylinder.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the drag exerted by randomly distributed,
	rigid, emergent circular cylinders of uniform diameter d. Laboratory
	measurements are presented for solid volume fraction phi=0.091, 0.15,
	0.20, 0.27, and 0.35 and cylinder Reynolds number Rep[equivalent]Upd/nu=25
	to 685, where Up=temporally and cross-sectionally averaged pore velocity
	and nu=kinematic viscosity. These ranges coincide with conditions
	in aquatic plant canopies. The temporally and cross-sectionally averaged
	drag coefficient, CD, decreased with increasing Rep and increased
	with increasing phi under the flow conditions investigated. The dimensionless
	ratio of the mean drag per unit cylinder length <[overline f[sub
	D]]>H to the product of the viscosity, ï¿½, and Up exhibits a linear
	Rep dependence of the form <[overline f[sub D]]>H/(ï¿½Up)=alpha0+alpha1Rep,
	consistent with Ergun's formulation for packed columns. In the range
	of experimental conditions, alpha1 increases monotonically with phi.
	In contrast, alpha0 is constant within uncertainty for 0.15<=phi<=0.35,
	which suggests that viscous drag per unit cylinder length is independent
	of phi in this range.},

	In the present model, a drifted body due to the tsunami is moved
	in terms of drag and inertia forces acting on the body, which are
	calculated with fluid velocity distributing on side faces of the
	body. Furthermore, a collision model is developed and integrated

	another drift body and a fixed body. A break model of mooring system
	is also developed and integrated with the drift model, by which a
	mooring vessel can start to be drifted when the mooring system is
	broken. The present model is qualitatively validated through conducting
	simple test runs, and applied to calculations in actual bathymetry

	down an inclined chute. We observe three major regimes: static piles,
	steady uniform flows and accelerating flows. For flows over a smooth
	base, other (quasi-steady) regimes are observed where the flow is
	either highly energetic and strongly layered in depth for small inclinations,
	or non-uniform and oscillating for larger inclinations. For steady
	uniform flows, depth profiles of density, velocity and stress have
	been obtained using an improved coarse-graining-method, which allows
	accurate statistics even at the base of the flow. A shallow-layer
	model for granular flows is completed with macro-scale closure relations
	obtained from micro-scale DPM simulations of steady flows. We thus
	obtain relations for the effective basal friction, shape factor,
	mean density, and the normal stress anisotropy as functions of layer
	thickness, flow velocity and basal roughness. For collisional flows,
	the functional dependencies are well determined and have been obtained.},

  abstract = {An expression for the stress tensor near an external boundary of a
	discrete mechanical system is derived explicitly in terms of the
	constituents' degrees of freedom and interaction forces. Starting
	point is the exact and general coarse graining formulation presented
	by Goldhirsch in [I.Goldhirsch, Gran.Mat., 12(3):239-252, 2010],
	which is consistent with the continuum equations everywhere but does
	not account for boundaries. Our extension accounts for the boundary
	interaction forces in a self-consistent way and thus allows the construction
	of continuous stress fields that obey the macroscopic conservation
	laws even within one coarse-graining width of the boundary. The resolution
	and shape of the coarse-graining function used in the formulation
	can be chosen freely, such that both microscopic and macroscopic
	effects can be studied. The method does not require temporal averaging
	and thus can be used to investigate time-dependent flows as well
	as static and steady situations. Finally, the fore-mentioned continuous
	field can be used to define ?fuzzy' (highly rough) boundaries. Two
	discrete particle method (DPM) simulations are presented in which

	coefficient with the depth of flow. A horsehair mattress is used
	in the experimental study to simulate the vegetation on the watercourses.
	Test results reveal that the roughness coefficient reduces with increasing
	depth under the unsubmerged condition. However, when fully submerged,
	the vegetative roughness coefficient tends to increase at low depths
	but then decrease to an asymptotic constant as the water level continues
	to rise. A simplified model based on force equilibrium is developed
	to evaluate the drag coefficient of the vegetal element; Manning's
	equation is then employed to convert the drag coefficient into the
	roughness coefficient. The data of this study are compared with those
	of selected previous laboratory and field tests. The results show
	a consistent trend of variation for the drag coefficient versus the
	Reynolds number. This trend can be represented by a vegetative characteristic
	number k. Given information such as the bed slope, the height of
	vegetation, and k, one can apply the proposed model to predict the
	roughness coefficient corresponding to different flow depths.},

  year = {2011},
  volume = {58},
  pages = {1-14},
  abstract = {With the climate change caused by global warming, the occurrence probability
	of urban flooding due to flash floods has increased gradually. Flush
	floods propagate rapidly, which can lead to significant hazard to
	human life and property. Flood hazard to vehicles has become more
	noticeable and frequent in recent years. Therefore, it is important
	to investigate the behaviour of vehicles on flooded streets or roads.
	In the current study, a formula has been derived to predict the incipient
	velocity of flooded vehicles according to the mechanical condition
	of sliding equilibrium. A series of flume experiments were conducted
	using three types of scaled die-cast model vehicles, with two scales
	being tested for each type of vehicle. The experimental data obtained
	for the small-scale model vehicles were used to determine the two
	parameters in the derived formula, and the prediction accuracy of
	this formula was validated using the experimental data obtained for
	the large-scale model vehicles. Finally, the corresponding incipient
	velocities under various incoming depths were computed using this
	formula for these three prototype vehicles. It is found that for
	a specified vehicle, the value of incipient velocity reaches its
	minimum as the incoming flow depth approaches the height of the vehicle,
	and the smaller and lighter vehicle like Mini Cooper is the easiest
	to start sliding in floodwaters. The results can be used as a preliminary
	assessment to define the hazard to vehicles parking on flooded streets
	or roads.},

	vegetation is described. A momentum balance is applied to each layer
	and expressions for the mean velocities are proposed. The velocity
	is assumed to be uniform in the vegetation layer and logarithmic
	in the upper layer. The proposed relationship successfully predicts
	the mean velocity distribution when compared with the measured data.
	Using the velocity formula, the layer-averaged mean velocities in
	the upper layer and over the entire layer are derived. An expression
	for the roughness coefficient increased by vegetation is also presented,
	performing better for the roughness coefficient than other formulas.
	Another relationship is proposed for predicting the distribution
	of suspended sediment in depth-limited flow with submerged vegetation
	by using an eddy-viscosity profile. The predicted profiles moderately
	agree with the measured data. Comparisons with simulated data from
	the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the k-\epsilon
	model suggest that these proposals successfully predict suspended
	sediment transport in a depth-limited flow with submerged vegetation.},

  abstract = {A pore-scale numerical model based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
	(SPH) is described for modelling fluid flow phenomena in porous media.
	Originally developed for astrophysics applications, SPH is extended
	to model incompressible flows of low Reynolds number as encountered
	in groundwater flow systems. In this paper, an overview of SPH is
	provided and the required modifications for modelling flow through
	porous media are described, including treatment of viscosity, equation
	of state, and no-slip boundary conditions. The performance of the
	model is demonstrated for two-dimensional flow through idealized
	porous media composed of spatially periodic square and hexagonal
	arrays of cylinders. The results are in close agreement with solutions
	obtained using the finite element method and published solutions
	in the literature. Copyright Â© 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
