\fancychapter{Numerical Discretization}
\label{cap:chapter-numerical}

\textit{In this chapter the discretization method is introduced and discussed, followed by a proposal for the discretization for the previously presented conceptual models. Competing formulations may be introduced in order to further justify a specific choice or drive a given idea. Continuous interpolation theory is explored, introducing interpolating kernels. Discrete interpolation is described and analysed, with discrete differential operators being derived. The \ac{DEM} method is introduced and expanded within the \ac{SPH} framework. A time integration scheme is introduced and discussed briefly, as well as the corresponding stability region.}
