\fancychapter{Validations and Tests}
\label{cap:chapter_validation}

\textit{This chapter attempts at quantifying the quality of the numerical solutions achieved with the methods introduced in Chapter \ref{cap:chapter-numerical}. Theoretical considerations and analytical solutions are taken into account when available, providing important comparison points. Experimental data is complied from literature and derived from measurements, allowing for a more comprehensive study of the numerical model when faced with complex scenarios.}

\textit{Unless otherwise stated, all simulations are performed with Equations \eqref{eq:sph_navier_cont}, \eqref{eq:sph_navier_momentum_I} with viscous terms from the laminar (Equation \ref{eq:sph_morris_laminar}) and SPS formulations (Equation \ref{eq:sph_sps_term}), \ac{EOS} (Equation \ref{eq:sph_state_equation}) and the non-linear contact mechanics models explored in Section \ref{sec:solid-discretization_force}.}
