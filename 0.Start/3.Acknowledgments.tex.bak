Existe muito por que estar grato aos meus pais. O sacrif\'{i}cio e a alegria com que o cometeram, as longas horas a lidar com uma mente incassi\'{a}vel, o ninho sempre pronto a que recorrer quando o mundo se demonstrou demasiado ventoso. A v\'{o}s. 

Ao Lu\'{i}s e Ana, pela infind\'{a}vel disponibilidade, pelo genu\'{i}no interesse e acima de tudo, pelo carinho sem fim. A v\'{o}s.

Ao meu irmão Diogo, pela presença constante

Aos meus tios, pelo sempre presente sorriso, boa disposi\c{c}\~{a}o e \'{o}ptimos conselhos de viagem. Pelo incondicional amor e disponibilidade com que sempre me presentearam.

I have been fortunate enough to share the stimulating working environments of two research groups. In all of CEris, I would like to thank particularly Ana Margarida, for proudly sharing the same space with someone as dubious as a numerics researcher. Daniel Conde for always being ready to defend the said numerics researcher, besides sharing my pains with compilers. To Artur Silva, for always bringing a new perspective, and particularly good 7th art recommendations. To Pedro Sanches, for transforming my descents into the pits of physical experimentation into highly enjoyable moments. I would also like to acknowledge Dulce Fernandes, Nuno Martins, Ana Quaresma, Rui Aleixo and Luis Mendes.

Part of my work was developed in UVigo, at EPHYSLAB, Ourense. Alejandro Crespo deserves special acknowledgment for the sheer effort to make me feel welcome and part of the team. Alex employed the full extend of his availability and critical approach to promote this work to a better level. He also took the entire team to the thermal baths whenever possible, in a great contribution towards the understanding of fluid mechanics. Jos\'{e} Domingu\'{e}z shared many hours looking at code and compiler warnings. I am ever so thankful to him, knowing that he made this work possible by helping me express my ideas within the computational maze that the project grew into. Anxo Barreiro, I will never forget that couch. A very big thank you to Angel Fernandez, Fran Santos, Orlando Feal, Xurxo, Corrado Altomare and Carlos Alvarado.

Behind a PhD there is always a well of vision, experience and support. I had two, Rui Ferreira and R\'{a}mon G\'{o}mez-Gesteira, my advisors. To both, I need to acknowledge the great opportunities that I was presented with. The amount of knowledge, patience and dedication devoted to this project make me proud, humbled and thankful. 

To FCT, for supporting the program with a full PhD scholarship, a fundamental requisite for its development.

To Olya, my wife, confidant and everything positive a being can be to another. For sharing everything with me, for transmuting the good into sublime and the bad to part of the good. For the endless monologues you had to endure and the love you poured into every attempt at supporting me. To you.
