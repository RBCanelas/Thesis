Flows of solid-fluid mixtures pose persistent challenges to our conceptualization, experimentation and modeling capabilities. The wide array of possibly relevant scales, both spatial and temporal, have prevented the design of conceptual models capable of providing useful solutions for complex, multi-scale situations. Competent models are applied to very specific scales and types of flow, facing severe problems out of their narrow domain of application.

This work attempts at reversing the traditional conceptualization paradigm. Direct observation, and even measurements of many of these flows characteristics are difficult or impossible to achieve, justifying the scattered literature on the subject of more robust conceptual models. With increasing computational capabilities, there is hope that highly resolved models with small number of assumptions can lead to approximate solutions for these flows. This has the potential to promote new research prompts, leading to better models.

A unified discretisation of rigid solids and fluids is introduced, allowing for resolved simulations of fluid-solid phases within a meshless framework. The numerical solution, attained by Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and a variation of Discrete Element Method (DEM), the Distributed Contact Discrete Element Method (DCDEM) discretisations, is achieved by directly considering solid-solid and solid-fluid interactions. The novelty of the work is centered on the generalization of the coupling of the DEM and SPH methodologies for resolved simulations, allowing for state-of-the-art contact mechanics theories to be used in arbitrary geometries, while fluid to solid and vice versa momentum transfers are accurately described. The methods are introduced, analyzed and discussed. 

An experimental campaign serves as a validation point for complex solid-fluid flows, where a set of blocks in several configurations is subjected to a dam-break wave. Blocks are tracked and positions are then compared between experimental data and the numerical solutions. A PIV technique allows for the quantification of the flow field and direct comparison with numerical data. The results show that the model is accurate and is capable of treating highly complex interactions, such as transport of debris or hydrodynamic actions on structures, if relevant scales are reproduced.
